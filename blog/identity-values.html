        <h2>Ethical Decision</h2>
        <p>
          While running my gym in Whanganui during the COVID restrictions I
          often felt stuck between what the government was demanding and what I
          thought was right for myself and my gym community. I didn’t agree with
          the push for the vaccine, it felt wrong and forced and I struggled
          becasue I believed the New Zealand government wasn’t being fully
          honest with us. To keep the gym alive I had to find ways to navigate
          the rules very carefully whilst balancing the official requirements. I
          needed to protect my livelihood and stay true to my own personal
          values. This expierience was a constant test of resilience.

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
          My culture has been shaped strongly by the example of my parents who
          both worked incredibly hard to build the lives they wanted. My mother
          is a New Zealand Maori who came from a very poor family and through
          determination she pushed herself forward while my father who is a New
          Zealand European was equally dedicated and hardworking in his career.
          Together they became successful in their chosen paths but also showed
          me the value of discipline. Growing up in that environment gave me a
          strong and solid foundation that continues to influence the person I
          am today.

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>
          As an Owl in the DOPE personality test one of my strengths is my
          analytical and detail oriented nature. I like to take my time to try
          and fully understand things, break down problems and look at
          situations logically before moving forward. I believe this approach
          will be a real advantage as I learn how to code. From my understanding
          programming requires patience and accuracy along with the ability to
          see how small details fit into a bigger picture. I tend to be quite
          methodical with my approach to things and I believe this will help me
          througout my coding journey.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          A limitation which could affect my learning is that I can sometimes be
          too independent preferring to figure things out on my own rather than
          reaching out for help. I think it could possibly slow me down and make
          learning challenges feel more difficult than they need to be. I do
          realize I will need to be more proactive when I face problems.

        <h2>Working With Others</h2>
        <p>
          When I was in my previous job as a manager one of the biggest
          challenges I faced was the lack of effective sales and operational
          systems from our head office. Despite this I took it upon myself to
          train staff in logistics, operations and sales by relying on logical
          strategies from my own previous experience. While these approaches
          were semi effective it was difficult to manage the variety of staff
          personalities within their roles when their roles were not fully
          defined and I found myself stretched between leading, training and
          trying to maintain consistency without proper systems in place.
          Looking back I believe I should have raised these concerns earlier in
          my employment and pushed harder for dedicated better systems and
          procedures that supported both the staff and the working conditions.
