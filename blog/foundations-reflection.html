        <h2>
          Role Of Values, Empathy, And Self-Awareness In Learning And
          Programming?
        </h2>
        <p>From my research, when combined, these qualities create a powerful learning loop: </p><br>
	<p>1-Self-awareness helps you recognise your current abilities and gaps</p>
	<p>2-	Values guide which gaps to prioritise filling</p>
	<p>3-	Empathy helps you understand problems from multiple perspectives</p>
	<p>4-	Self-awareness helps you evaluate your progress honestly</p>
	<p>5-	Values keep you motivated through difficult learning curves</p><br>

In programming specifically, this can manifest as developers who write code that's not just functional, but thoughtful.

        <h2>Three New Things Learnt During Human Skills?</h2>
        <p>
          I learnt that I need to focus on my EQ. That I need to ensure my brain
          is able to accept new information by having the right mindset. That I
          need to slow down and relax when I am faced with complex problems.

        <h2>
          What Has Surprised You The Most About The Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The EQ part and mindfulness really hit hard for me. I was quite surprised as it made me aware that 
          I need to practise and be conscious of both in my normal everyday life.

        <h2>
          What Were The Most Challenging Aspects Of The Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          For me I found the creative writing quite challenging to get through
          and found I spent allot of extra time writing, re writing and reading, but I am happy with the improvments I have made.

        <h2>
          Why Does Dev Academy Focus On Human Skills In A Web Dev Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think that you focus allot on Human Skills as they are very
          important skills to have as a developer. If you can code well but
          struggle to communicate or work with others, you could face serious
          limitations in your tech career. Placing so much emphasis on Human
          Skills ensures your school will have well rounded graduates.

        <h2>Does Human Skills Feel like A Waste Of Time?</h2>
        <p>
          No it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I think it has been good to
          learn more about myself and understanding the importance of human
          skills in tech. However I do find some of the programming hard to get
          a grasp on. I feel it has been beneficial overall.
