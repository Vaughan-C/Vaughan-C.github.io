        <h2>A Simple Problem And Solving It</h2>
        <p>
          I encountered several challenges with the Kata content, but the most
          significant was the Flip Flop exercise. I made the mistake of
          attempting to write an entirely new function when the foundation was
          already provided. This error left me stuck for ages and ages. My
          initial approach was to systematically break down the code and
          identify where it was failing, but I couldn't pinpoint the issue.
          Eventually I decided to set it aside and move on to the next exercise.
          I returned to it the following day with a positive attitude, I took a
          more methodical approach. I went through the code line by line,
          created pseudocode to map out the logic, then verified each step.
          Everything appeared correct, which was frustrating and confusing. Then
          I had a breakthrough, I finally saw my error, I was trying to build
          the function from scratch when it was already partially built. I
          needed to complete the existing function rather than start over. Once
          this clicked, the solution became clear. I feel if I had slowed down
          in my mind as Javascript makes me a little anxious, I would have seen
          the function already semi-written and worked of that. I did feel so
          much relief when I worked this out.

        <p><b>Pseudocode :</b>I feel confident using this</p>
        <p>
          <b>Trying something :</b>I found I needed to try allot of different

        <h2>Asking For Help</h2>
        <p>
          During the Flip Flop challenge, I hesitated to ask for help early on
          because I felt anxious and was determined to solve it myself. In
          retrospect, given how much time I spent struggling with it. I would
          have saved considerable time and effort by seeking assistance from the
          tutors after a few attempts. Especially considering my code was
          correct all along thus confusing me even more at the time.
