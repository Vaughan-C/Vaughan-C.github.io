        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are reusable blocks of code created to perform a specific
          task. They allow the developer to write a task once and execute it
          multiple times. This help’s reduce repetition and keep their code
          organised. Functions also enable interactivity by allowing websites to
          respond to specific user actions or inputs. Developers set the
          <strong
            >parameters - the variable names listed in the function's
            definition.
          </strong>
          The user then responds with the
          <strong
            >argument - the real values passed to the function when it is
            called.</strong
          >

        <h2>Arrays And Objects</h2>
        <p>
          An array is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of
          elements. It provides a powerful way for developers to manage multiple
          related values within a single variable, think of viewing a list of
          fruit and selecting one fruit item from the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          An object is a way to group related data together. Instead of just
          storing values in a list like an array, an object stores data in key
          value pairs. This means every piece of information has a name (the
          key), making the developers code much more descriptive and easier to
          understand.

        <h2>Control Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow statements determine the execution order of code. They
          introduce logic by evaluating conditions to decide which code blocks
          to run. For example in this case the if statement acts as a digital
          decision point: if (isRaining) { takeUmbrella } it's mimicking the
          human thought process of adapting to circumstances.

        <h2>Loops</h2>
        <p>
          Loops automate repetitive tasks in a developers code. You use them
          whenever you need the same action performed multiple times. This is
          crucial for processing collections of data or running operations until
          a condition is met. An example is tracking progress towards a goal.
          The loop set is a counter of how many calories you've eaten and stops
          once you hit your daily goal of say 2000.

        <h2>The Dom</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
          pages. It creates a structured or tree like representation of the HTML
          document, where each tag, attribute, and piece of text becomes a
          branch on that tree. Developers then use JavaScript to interact with
          the tree, this allows them to dynamically change the content,
          structure and style of a page without needing the browser to reload
          it.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Think of web development like being a music producer,</p>
        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> is your sample pack and vocal - the raw audio files and
          core elements you have to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> CSS</b> is you EQ, compressor, and reverb - it's how you shape
          those sounds, adjust the levels, and make everything blend together
          beautifully.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>JavaScript </b>is your MIDI controller and automation - its what
          lets you trigger samples live and create complex filter sweeps which
          completes the track.
        </p>
        <p>You need all three to produce a track/website that moves.</p>
