        <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
        <p>
          I have a keen interest in cypto, blockchain and smart contracts. I
          believe that they will all play a huge role in the coming years as a
          means of transacting value. RWA tokenisation is gaining massive
          traction in overseas markets, so keeping this in mind, I would like to
          be involved somehow within that field as a long term goal. I am not
          entirely sure how yet but I think the Dev Academy is a great starting
          point to make that shift for me in the future. I have always wanted to
          learn how to build.

        <h2>Strengths And Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the fact of my age and not undertaking any learning for over 28
          years, I am still working this stuff out as I go. But to start off,
          having a keen interest in what I am studying will play a major role in
          my motivation to learn and understand. I need to ensure that I revisit
          all of information on planned basis and structure my days accordingly
          so I can retain and recall everything learned.

        <h2>Skills I Would Like To Develop</h2>
        <p>
          The main skills non tech skills I’d like to see myself develop over
          this time are creative writing and just my creativity in general. I am
          liking the human aspect to the sprints and feel they will help me with
          my comunication and self development and understanding.

        <h2>How I Will Manage The Workload</h2>
        <p>
          I intend to ensure that I have a good solid weekly plan and break
          things down daily. I intend to re-visit all the materials on a
          schduled day to ensure that the information is understood and
          retained. I found the first few weeks quite an adjustment as I had
          been working full time up until the program started. I ended up
          cramming a fair bit of work into the weekends as I didn't have a solid
          plan in those weeks. I feel this week I am on a better path as I have
          settled more into the learning. I intend to be more active on the
          discord and comunicate more with my peers and facilitators. I will do
          this all in a safe manor. When things build up as I am sure they will,
          I intend to have a good plan in place and reach out for help if I need
          to.

        <h2>How I Will Seek Help</h2>
        <p>
          If I am faced with challenges that I am unable to solve, I will ensure
          to seek out the help of facilitatrs. I will seek help when needed from
          other students and will be happy to help others out when and if asked.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Expect From Facilitators</h2>
        <p>
          I expect them to be available when needed and to be able to answer any
          questions and provide the neccessary support at the time. From what I
          have seen on discord, this seams to be the case.
