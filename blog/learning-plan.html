        <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
        <p>
          I have a keen interest in cypto, blockchain and smart contracts. I
          believe that they will all play a huge role in the coming years as a
          means of transacting value. RWA tokenisation is gaining massive
          traction in overseas markets, so keeping this in mind, I would like to
          be involved somehow within that field as a long term goal. I am not
          entirely sure how yet but I think the Dev Academy is a great starting
          point to make that shift for me in the future. I have always wanted to
          learn how to build.

        <h2>Strengths And Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the fact of my age and not undertaking any learning for over 28
          years, I am still working this stuff out as I go. But to start off,
          having a keen interest in what I am studying will play a major role in
          my motivation to learn and understand. I need to ensure that I revisit
          all of information on planned basis and structure my days accordingly
          so I can retain and recall everything learned.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills I Would Like To Develop</h2>
        <p>
          The main skills non tech skills I’d like to see myself develop over
          this time are creative writing and just my creativity in general. I am
          liking the human aspect to the sprints and feel they will help me with
          my comunication and self development and understanding.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Will Manage The Workload</h2>
        <p>
          I intend to ensure that I have a good solid weekly plan and break
          things down daily. I intend to re-visit all the materials on a
          schduled day to ensure that the information is understood and
          retained. I found the first few weeks quite an adjustment as I had
          been working full time up until the program started. I ended up
          cramming a fair bit of work into the weekends as I didn't have a solid
          plan in those weeks. I feel this week I am on a better path as I have
          settled more into the learning. I intend to be more active on the
          discord and comunicate more with my peers and facilitators. I will do
          this all in a safe manor. When things build up as I am sure they will,
          I intend to have a good plan in place and reach out for help if I need
          to.

        <h2>How I Will Seek Help</h2>
        <p>
          If I am faced with challenges that I am unable to solve, I will ensure
          to seek out the help of facilitatrs. I will seek help when needed from
          other students and will be happy to help others out when and if asked.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Expect From Facilitators</h2>
        <p>
          I expect them to be available when needed and to be able to answer any
          questions and provide the neccessary support at the time. From what I
          have seen on discord, this seams to be the case.

        <h2>Bootcamp - Learning Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I'll continue with the system that's proven effective for me taking my
          time with new concepts and being consistent with my study routine.
          Since I know learning takes me a bit longer, I'm not going to rush
          things or compare my pace to others. I'll keep doing the extra
          learning and practice outside of class hours because that's when
          things really start to click for me. My creative writing is going
          well, so I want to maintain that momentum and maybe even push myself a
          bit further in that area.
        </p>

        <h2>Bootcamp - Daily Structure</h2>
        <p>
          I'm going to stick with what's working: maintaining my training
          schedule (with added cardio workouts), keeping my sleep and eating
          habits consistent, and making sure I stay connected with my support
          network. These fundamentals are keeping my stress levels low and my
          mind clear for learning, so they're non-negotiable. I'll continue
          balancing my study with these wellbeing practices because I've noticed
          they actually help me absorb information better.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Bootcamp - Managing Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          When I hit a wall with understanding something new, I'll remind myself
          that this is normal for me and just means I need to spend a bit more
          time with it. I won't let it stress me out. I'll break difficult
          concepts down into smaller chunks and revisit them consistently until
          they make sense. If needed, I'll reach out for help or find additional
          resources to approach the material from different angles.
        </p>

        <h2>Bootcamp - Personal Wellbeing</h2>
        <p>
          While my stress levels are good overall, I'm aware that my dad's
          situation is on my mind. I'll make sure to check in with him regularly
          and start thinking practically about what support he might need. This
          won't interfere with my studies, but acknowledging it means it won't
          catch me off guard either. I'll also be mindful of how the increased
          cardio affects my mood and energy levels - this is my wellbeing
          experiment for the coming weeks.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Bootcamp - Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is simple: keep doing what I'm doing because it's working.
          Don't give up when things get tough, stay consistent with my routine,
          and trust that my system will carry me through to the end of bootcamp
          successfully.
