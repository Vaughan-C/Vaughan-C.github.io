        <h2>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h2>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori model of health that depicts wellbeing as
          a whare (house). Its four walls are Taha Tinana (physical health),
          Taha Hinengaro (mental and emotional health), Taha Wairua (spiritual
          health), and Taha Whānau (family and social health). Together, they
          hold up the roof. The model is founded upon Whenua (land and roots),
          which provides stability and connection.
