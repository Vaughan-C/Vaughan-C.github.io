        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          neuroplasticity is beneficial because it shifts your perception of the
          brain from a static and hardwired organ to a dynamic and adaptable
          system that we can actively shape throughout our entire lives. My
          research indicated the following points as being the most important to
          note.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Fosters a growth mindset and reduces helplessness</li>
          <li>It informs and motivates any rehabilitation</li>
          <li>It enhances learning any kind of new skills</li>
          <li>This provides a framework for managing mental health</li>
          <li>
            It encourages healthy lifestyle choices that support brain health
          </li>
          <li>It helps with breaking bad habits and addictions</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          By making conscious choices about our thoughts, behaviors, and
          environment we are not just acting on our brain, we are actively
          rewiring it. This can transform our experience from one of
          predetermined fate to one of continuous potential and self-directed
          growth.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is a concept developed by renowned Stanford
          psychologist Carol S. Dweck, based on decades of research on
          achievement and success. It describes the underlying beliefs people
          have about their learning and intelligence. A growth mindset is best
          described below.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your basic abilities are not fixed. They can be developed and
            strengthened through dedication, hard work, and perseverance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talent is just the starting point. Challenges allong with effort,
            and failure are not signs of unintelligence but are essential
            opportunities for growth and for stretching your existing abilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brain is malleable. This is directly supported by the science of
            neuroplasticity, which shows that the brain can form new neural
            connections throughout life in response to learning and experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            It provides a framework for managing any mental health situation
          </li>
          <br />
          <p>
            The relevance of a growth mindset extends far beyond academic
            achievement. It is a powerful framework for personal and
            professional development in virtually every aspect of life.

        <h2>How Will They Affect My Learning ?</h2>
        <p>
          This has been a really interesting topic/s to research. I feel my
          study and personal life can benefit from adapting these fundermentals
          into my days. I need to ensure to keep a positive mindset and not let
          things affect me so much. I feel that my physical training and
          nutrition has been good throughout my course so far. I also need to
          ensure that I give my work especially javascript good focus moving
          forward.
