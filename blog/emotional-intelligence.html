        <h2>What Makes Up Emotional Intelligence ?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Social skills</b> - Working well with others</li>
          <li>
            <b>Empathy </b> - Being able to see things from other peoples
            perspective
          </li>
          <li><b>Self-regulation</b> - Staying calm under pressure</li>
          <li>
            <b>Self-awareness</b> - Knowing how your emotions affect your
            behaviour
          </li>

        <p>
          From my research and findings, it seams EQ is mainly based on the
          above points. They ae listed in no particular order.

        <h2>How is IQ different to EQ ?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ or intelligence quotient is what helps you do well in school and
          possibly land a decent paying job because it measures your ability to
          think logically and solve problems. This means you could obtain better
          grades in your chosen subjects thus landing a higher paying job.
        </p>
        <p>
          EQ or emotional intelligence is what helps you handle strees, build
          relationships, work well with others and stay motivated. This means in
          a work situation with high EQ, you could possibly deal very well with
          other workers and make things tick along very smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the differnces a simple way to descibe the two is IQ might
          open the door for you, but EQ is what helps you thrive and succeed
          after you have walked in that door.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence, in my opinion is very important for us as
          humans because we are constantly interacting with one another in our
          daily lives. Having strong emotional intelligence gives us the ability
          to communicate better, show empathy, manage conflicts, and most
          importantly build healthier relationships. It is the key to creating
          understanding and that then creates connection. There are many tests
          available online that can help you work out your EQ level. I know
          myself after completing this research, I intent to be more conscious
          of this in my everyday life.
